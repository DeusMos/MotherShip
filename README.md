Is a simple remote mangment tool, that allows you to connect securly with LDAP to any regestered machine with ssh and/or VNC 

for example 
rmd ssh targetMachine 
will ssh to the machine registered as targetMachine via a secure jump server, handeling all the forwards for you. 

!currently the portal will only run on woodfam.us
!currently we only have one jumpserver instance hard coded.
